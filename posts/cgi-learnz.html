                When you request the endpoint <a href="https://rickysquid.org/cgi-bin/barfback">/cgi-bin/barfback</a>
                from this domain, <a href="https://httpd.apache.org/">Apache</a> uses <a href="https://www.w3.org/CGI/">CGI</a> 
                to call an executable which was compiled using gcc from plain c++ source!
                When the request comes in a process is spawned to run my program
                code, which merely spits back (or barfs-back) the remote ip address of the user fed to it by the rules dictated by CGI.

                Basically, when apache spins up a process to run my program, CGI determines a bunch of environment variables it sets for the 
                child proc, and then also how STDIN and STDOUT are used for POST data and responses. Originally, I'd been barfing-back the 
                query string from the URL, but I was open to code injection and need to escape html strings! Gotta research that more before 
                I switch that back. Anyway, I also can get mails here now at this domain, under the first name in the title of the site.
