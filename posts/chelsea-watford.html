		I've been watching just a terrific amount of soccer games lately, 
		last nights being Valencia vs. Granada (although I leant on the remote in 
		the 65th minute and was too lazy to put it back on) and Chelsea vs Watford.
		In the latter game, Pulisic earned the London side a penalty for the second game 
		running - the last one being against another at-risk-for-relegation team - Villa.
		I didn't know much about Granada CF and I guess I still don't - but they played well
		in the ~60 min I watched, and had the game level at 1-1 when I botched up the viewing.
		Two players familiar to fans of some other London clubs might recognize Rob Soldado of 
		Granada (ex-Spurs) &amp; Gabrielle Paulista of Valencia (ex-Arsenal). Carlos Fernandes of
		Granada impressed and took a nice penalty. Also watched Real Madrid vs Athletic Bilbao 
		but that game wasn't too exciting - can't even recall who earned the pen that got Real 
		the winning goal (finished 1-0), but Sergio Ramos dispatched it nicely. I'm gonna put on 
		Villareal vs Barcelona from today at some point - Barca are now 7 points behind Real 
		with a game in hand.
