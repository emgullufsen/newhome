        <p>
            Watched both Madrid sides - Real beat Getafe & Atletico bested Mallorca. Both were at home despite that 
            meaning less in the absence of home fans. Also saw Real Sociedad come from a goal down to overcome Espanyol de Barcelona 
            2 - 1. Finding the more technical Spanish league more fun to watch than the Premier League at the moment - also there's still a 
            title race on there, and the commentators on BeIn Sports are much better than those of NBC Sports 
            (despite the necessity of muting Ray "Magesterial!" Hudson on BeIn).
