            Phoebe Waller-Bridge and her show deserve all the breathless praise they're getting. 
            No show has proved as unpredictable and rewarding as this. The final scene at the bustop 
            need not be diagrammed, but it was a nice combination of punches. Normally I think 
            breaking the fourth wall is lame, but on Fleabag it eventually serves the chemistry of 
            the Priest and the titular character.
