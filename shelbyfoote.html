        <p>
            

I've been reading this narrative and it's really terrific. If you've seen the author's 
appearance on Ken Burns' The Civil War Documentary, you'll already know the man has a s
pecial Mississippi drawl. He has been accused of favoring the South ‐ specifically of having 
too kind of words for Nathan Bedford Forrest, first Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan. 
So that's not a great look by him. So far from my reading,]... Foote does revel in describing 
a phenomenon like the Rebel Yell to a degree you might expect of a partisan, but then points 
out the arrogance and unsoundness of the Southerners inflated opinion of his martial ability, 
in comparison to the Yankee. In effect, even though the average Southern soldier came into his 
army with a familiarity with arms and horses, after the inexperienced Yankee had several months 
of drill, he nullified the whatever initial disadvantage suffered.
