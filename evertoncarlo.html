        <p>
            I'm very excited by the hiring of Carlo Ancelotti by Everton FC. 
            This is a world-class manager who's won a league title in Italy, 
            England, France, Spain, and Germany! He's managed Bayern & Madrid! 
            It's quite bananas that Everton have him now.
